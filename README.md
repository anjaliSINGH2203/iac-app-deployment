## Infrastructure as Code and Application Deployment

This repository demonstrates a basic infrastructure setup and application deployment using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) principles.

**1. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**

* **Provisioning**
    * **Compute Environment:**
        * Utilizes Docker for containerization.
        * The specific IaC tool (CloudFormation, Terraform, etc.) will be chosen based on the target cloud provider.
    * **Networking:**
        * Creates a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) for network isolation.
        * Defines subnets within the VPC for organizing resources.
        * Configures Security Groups to control inbound and outbound traffic to the instances.
        * Implements Firewall Rules to further restrict network access.

* **Best Practices**
    * **Modularity:** Infrastructure code is divided into reusable modules for better organization and maintainability.
    * **Idempotency:** Infrastructure code can be applied multiple times without unintended side effects.
    * **Version Control:** All infrastructure code is stored in a version control system (e.g., Git) for tracking changes and facilitating rollbacks.
    * **Testing:** Unit and integration tests are implemented to validate the infrastructure code before deployment.

**2. Application Deployment**

* **Application**
    * A simple backend application (e.g., Node.js or Python REST API) is used as an example.

* **Containerization**
    * The application is packaged into a Docker container for portability and isolation.

* **Deployment**
    * The Docker container is deployed to the cloud environment created using the IaC.

* **HTTPS**
    * The application is accessible only via HTTPS using SSL/TLS encryption for secure communication.

**3. Security Configuration**

* **Secrets Management**

    Sensitive information (e.g., API keys, database credentials) is stored securely using:

    * **AWS Secrets Manager:** (if using AWS)
    * **Hashicorp Vault:** (for a more general and robust solution)
    * **Environment Variables:** (for simpler cases, but ensure proper protection in your deployment environment)

    Secrets are accessed by the application through secure mechanisms.

**4. CI/CD Pipeline**

* **Pipeline Tool**

    A CI/CD pipeline is created using a tool like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, or Azure DevOps.

* **Pipeline Steps**
    * **Build:** The Docker image for the application is built.
    * **Test:** Unit and integration tests are executed to ensure application quality.
    * **Deploy:** The Docker image is deployed to the target environment.

* **Version Control**

    The CI/CD pipeline configuration files are stored in the same repository as the application and infrastructure code for better management.

**5. Documentation**

* **Architecture**

    A diagram or textual description of the overall architecture is provided. This includes the components (VPC, subnets, security groups, instances, load balancers, etc.) and their interactions.

* **Setup Replication**

    Detailed instructions are provided on how to replicate the entire setup. This includes steps for setting up the infrastructure, deploying the application, and configuring the CI/CD pipeline.

* **Application Testing**

    Instructions are provided on how to test the deployed application. This may include API endpoints to call, data to send, and expected responses.
